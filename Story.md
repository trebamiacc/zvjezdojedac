## Introduction ##

Human imagination came up with numerous beast of terror, size, magic and beauty. Some of them are so huge that they can only live between the stars. Stareaters are beasts such as these, giant amoebas that swallow stars awhole.

## Project Orion ##

Every decision we made, stays with as in this world and other we did not make here are made in worlds parallel to our own. In some of these worlds, our civilization is again (or still) reaching for a barren lands of Solar system. In some of these worlds, competitors launched large colony ships filled with thousands of settlers on voyage to distant lands. Whatever is their destination, Mars, Ganimed, or maybe even Venus, many of them will fail. Without knowing what is going on along axis of 5th dimension, they fired the Orion engines at same almost spot in 3D space, at almost same time, under the watch of stareater.


## Missing stars ##

Being as huge as dwarf galaxy, stareater would rather pick a glowing star over cold spaceships for its diet but this one was fooled. Being as simple (stupid) as amoeba it simply swallowed something with heavy neutrino emission and low mass thinking it was some weird dwarf star. Many of these victims ended up in interstellar oblivion of stareaters pocket space but few hunderds were lucky enough. Lucky to end up in range of habitable planet. In some way, they succeeded in their mission, they have colonized extra terrestial land but it will be long struggle until news of that conquest find their way to Earth.

## Planets in stareater ##

Stareaters usually do not absorb whole star system, only a star in a center of gravity well, leaving it's planets wandering in darkness. But why are there planets inside this particular stareater? Stareaters are in general old beasts and almost all stars this one absorbed were 2nd generation by the time, few of then 1st generation and next to nothing 3rd generation. Our Sun is 3rd generation star, meaning it has already died two times and reformed for the 3rd time. By each rebirth of star, some stellar material (released by stars death) escapes the pull of new star and forms nebulae and satellite bodies like planets, asteroids or comets.
